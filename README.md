PlinkerUI!
===================

This little PHP project is a small demonstration usage for Plinker.

----------

Features:
---------

**What does it do?**
So it has many uses for a range of things.

 - Its very speedy! Instant and live updates though RPC, no need to poll server or when not in use.
 - Ive chosen to write it with a "no-framework" structure to allow people to understand it more.
 - Ive chosen to not apply a fancy theme, to keep assets and HTML less cluttered.

Nodes
-----

Nodes are any instances of Plinker which you want to control.
